# Getting Started with Create React state

#### Mounting / Rendering - 
When the react application upload for the first time , this process is called rendering / mounting .

##  STATE in react -

* STATE -> A state is used to contain data or information about the component where it is defined. 
-> State is an internal private property/object of class based component .
-> State determines the behaviour of the component and how it will render.
-> After assigning a value to the state property once, we can't reassign it anywhere in the component .
-> In state we can only define object.
-> Since we can't reassign it, so to update the state , we can use this.setState().


### Re-rendering depends on these - 
1. state - update in state 
2. props - change in props
